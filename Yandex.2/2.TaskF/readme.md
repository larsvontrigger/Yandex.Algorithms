# Symmetry
A sequence of numbers is called symmetrical if it is read 
the same way from left to right and from right to left. 
For example, the following sequences are symmetrical:

1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1

1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1

Your program will be given a sequence of numbers. It is 
required to determine the minimum number and types of 
numbers that must be added to the end of this sequence to 
make it symmetrical.

## Input format
First, enter the number N — the number of elements of the 
original sequence (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Then come N numbers — 
the elements of this sequence, natural numbers from 1 to 
9.

## Output format
First, output the number M — the minimum number of 
elements that must be added to the sequence, and then M 
numbers (each from 1 to 9) — the numbers that must be 
added to the sequence.
