# A closest number
Write a program that finds the element in an array that 
is closest in magnitude to a given number.

## Input format
The first line specifies one natural number N, not 
exceeding 1000 – the array size. The second line contains 
N numbers – the array elements (integers not exceeding 
1000 in absolute value). The third line specifies one 
integer x, not exceeding 1000 in absolute value.

## Output format
Output the value of the array element closest to x. If 
there are several such numbers, output any of them.
