# Type of progression
Based on the sequence of numbers in the input data, 
determine its type:

CONSTANT – the sequence consists of identical values
ASCENDING – the sequence is strictly increasing
WEAKLY ASCENDING – the sequence is not strictly increasing
DESCENDING – the sequence is strictly decreasing
WEAKLY DESCENDING – the sequence is not strictly 
decreasing
RANDOM – the sequence does not belong to any of the above 
types
## Input format
The numbers of the sequence ai, |ai| ≤ 10^9, are entered 
one by one per line.

The number -2 × 10^9 indicates the end of the sequence. It 
is not included in the sequence.

## Output format
In a single line, output the sequence type.
