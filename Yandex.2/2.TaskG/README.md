# The greatest product of two numbers

You are given a list filled with arbitrary integers. Find two numbers in this list whose product is the greatest. Print these numbers in non-decreasing order.

The list contains at least two elements. The numbers are chosen so that the answer is unambiguous.

The solution must have complexity O(n), where n is the size of the list.
