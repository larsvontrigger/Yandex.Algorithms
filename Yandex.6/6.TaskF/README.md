# Very easy task
Today's jury meeting decided to add another, Very Easy Problem to the 
Olympiad version. The responsible secretary of the organizing committee 
printed its conditions in one copy, and now he needs to make N more 
copies before the Olympiad begins. He has two photocopiers, one of which 
copies a sheet in x seconds, the other in 1. (It is allowed to use one 
photocopier or both at the same time. You can copy not only from the 
original, but also from the copies.) Help him figure out what is the 
minimum time required for this.

## Input format
The program input is three natural numbers N, x and y, separated by 
spaces (1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 108, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10).

## Output format
You enter one number - the minimum time in seconds required to obtain N 
copies.
