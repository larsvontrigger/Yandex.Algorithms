# Approximate binary search
For each of the numbers, find the second one in the sequence closest 
to it in the first one.

## Input format
The first line of the input data contains the numbers N and K (). The 
second line contains the N numbers of the first array, sorted in 
non-decreasing order, and the third line contains the K numbers of the 
second array. Each number in both arrays does not exceed 2â‹…109 in 
absolute value.

## Output format
For each of the K numbers, you must compose the text of the first 
number from the array that is closest to the setting. If there are 
several, you make the smallest of them.
