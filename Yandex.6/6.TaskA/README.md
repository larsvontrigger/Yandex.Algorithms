# Binary search
Implement binary search in an array

## Input format
The first line of the input data contains natural numbers N and K (). 
The second line specifies N elements of the first array, and the third 
line specifies K elements of the second array. The elements of both 
arrays are integers, each of which does not exceed 109 in absolute 
value

## Output format
For each of the K numbers, it is required to output "YES" in a 
separate line if this number occurs in the first array, and "NO" 
otherwise.
