# Wires
N wire segments of length L1, L2, ..., LN centimeters are given. It is 
required to obtain K equal segments of the greatest possible length, 
expressed as an integer number of centimeters, by cutting them. If it is 
impossible to obtain K segments of length even 1 cm, output 0.

## Input format
The first line contains the numbers N and K. The next N lines contain L1, 
L2, ..., LN, one number per line.

Limitations: 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10,000, 100 ≤ Li ≤ 10,000,000, all numbers are 
integers.

## Output format
Output one number - the obtained length of the segments.
