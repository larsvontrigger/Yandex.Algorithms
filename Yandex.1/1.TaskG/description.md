# Metal alloy
There are N kg of a metal alloy. It is used to make blanks weighing K kg each. After 
that, parts weighing M kg each are turned from each blank (the maximum possible 
number of parts are turned from each blank). If any of the blanks are left after 
this, this material is returned to the beginning of the production cycle and alloyed 
with what was left over from the manufacture of the blanks. If the resulting alloy 
is sufficient to make at least one blank, then blanks are made from it again, from 
them - parts, etc. Write a program that will calculate how many parts can be 
obtained using this technology from the initially available N kg of alloy.

## Input format
N, K, M are entered. All numbers are natural and do not exceed 200.

## Output format
Output one number - the number of parts that can be obtained using this technology.
