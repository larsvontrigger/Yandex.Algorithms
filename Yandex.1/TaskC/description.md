# Phone number
Phone numbers in the mobile phone address book have one of the following formats: +7<code><number>, 8<code><number>, <number>, where <number> is seven digits, and <code> is three digits or three digits in parentheses. If the code is not specified, it is assumed to be 495. In addition, a phone number entry may contain a “-” sign between any two digits (see example). At the moment, Vasya has only three phone numbers in his phone’s address book, and he wants to add another one there. But he cannot figure out whether such a number is already in the phone book. Help him! Two phone numbers are the same if they have the same codes and the same numbers. For example, +7(916)0123456 and 89160123456 are the same number.

## Input format
The first line of the input data contains the phone number that Vasya wants to add to his phone’s address book. The next three lines contain three phone numbers that are already in Vasya's phone address book. It is guaranteed that each entry matches one of the three formats given in the condition.

## Output format
For each phone number in the address book, output YES (in capital letters) if it matches the phone number that Vasya wants to add to the address book, or NO (in capital letters) otherwise.
