# System of linear equations
The numbers a, b, c, d, e, f are given. Solve the system 
of linear equations

## Input format
You enter 6 real numbers - the coefficients of the 
equations.

## Output format
The program output depends on the type of solution to 
this system. If the system has no solutions, the program 
should output the single number 0. If the system has 
infinitely many solutions, each of which is of the form 
y=kx+b, the program should output the number 1, and then 
the values ​​of k and b. If the system has a single 
solution (x0,y0), the program should output the number 2, 
and then the values ​​of x0 and y0. If the system has 
infinitely many solutions of the form x=x0, y is any, the 
program should output the number 3, and then the value of 
x0. If the system has infinitely many solutions of the 
form y=y0, x is any, the program should output the number 
4, and then the value of y0. If any pair of numbers (x,y) 
is a solution, then the program should output the number 
5.

The numbers x0 and y0 will be checked with an accuracy of 
five digits after the point.
