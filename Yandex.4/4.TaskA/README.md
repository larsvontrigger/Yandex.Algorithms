# Synonyms dictionary
You are given a dictionary consisting of pairs of words. Each 
word is a synonym for its pair. All words in the dictionary are 
different. For one given word, determine its synonym.

## Input format
The program receives as input the number of pairs of synonyms 
N. Then follow N lines, each line contains exactly two 
words-synonyms. After this follows one word.

## Output format
The program must output a synonym for the given word. Note

This problem can be solved without dictionaries (by storing all 
the input data in a list), but the solution with a dictionary 
will be simpler.
