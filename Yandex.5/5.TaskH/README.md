# Substring
In this problem, you need to find the longest substring of a given 
string such that each character occurs in it no more than k times.

## Input format
The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ k 
≤ n ), where n is the number of characters in the string. The 
second line contains n characters – the given string, consisting 
only of lowercase Latin letters.

## Output format
Print two numbers into the output file – the length of the desired 
substring and the number of its first character. If there are 
several solutions, print any one.
