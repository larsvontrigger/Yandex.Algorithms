# Triangles
Petya has been studying in a math club for quite a long time, so he 
has already mastered not only the rules for performing simple 
operations, but also such a complex concept as symmetry. In order 
to better study symmetry, Petya decided to start with the simplest 
geometric figures - triangles. He soon realized that so-called 
isosceles triangles have axial symmetry. So now Petya is looking 
for such triangles everywhere.

Let us recall that a triangle is called isosceles if its area is 
positive and it has at least two equal sides.

Recently, Petya, entering the classroom, saw that n dots were drawn 
on the board. Of course, he immediately wondered how many triplets 
of these dots exist, which are the vertices of isosceles triangles.

It is necessary to write a program that solves the specified 
problem.

## Input format
The input file contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1500). Each of the 
subsequent lines contains two integers - xi and yi - the 
coordinates of the i-th point. The coordinates of the points do not 
exceed 109 in absolute value. There are no matching points among 
the given points.
