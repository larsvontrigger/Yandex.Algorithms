# 'Che' Sity
In the center of the city of Che there is a pedestrian street - one of the most popular places 
for walking for city residents. It is very pleasant to walk along this street, because along 
the street there are n funny monuments.

A girl Masha from the city of Che likes two boys from her school, and she can’t decide between 
them. In order to make a final decision, she decided to arrange a date with both boys at the 
same time. Masha wants to choose two monuments on the pedestrian street, near which the boys 
will wait for her. At the same time, she wants to choose such monuments that the boys will not 
see each other. Masha knows that because of the fog, the boys will see each other only if they 
are no more than r meters away.

Masha became interested in how many ways there are to choose two different monuments for 
organizing dates.
