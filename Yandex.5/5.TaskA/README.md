# Stylish clothes
Gleb loves shopping. Once he got the idea to pick out a T-shirt 
and pants so that he would look as stylish as possible. In Gleb's 
understanding, the more stylish the clothes are, the smaller the 
difference in the color of the elements of his clothes.

There are N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000) T-shirts and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100 000) 
pants, each element has a known color (an integer from 1 to 
10 000 000). Help Gleb choose one T-shirt and one pair of pants 
so that the difference in their colors is as small as possible.

## Input format
First, the information about the T-shirts is entered: in the 
first line, the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) and in the second 
line, N integers from 1 to 10,000,000 — the colors of the 
available T-shirts. It is guaranteed that the color numbers are 
in ascending order (in particular, no two T-shirts have the same 
colors).

Next, in the same format, is the description of the pants: their 
number M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100,000) and in the next line, M integers from 
1 to 10,000,000 in ascending order — the colors of the pants.

## Output format
Print a pair of non-negative numbers — the color of the T-shirt 
and the color of the pants that Gleb should choose. If there are 
several options, print any of them.
